# CONTRIBUTING

We're excited that you're considering contributing to Zorro! This is a new project and things are moving fast. As a result, we may not have bandwidth to do as good a job onboarding new contributors or quickly reviewing pull requests as we would like. (That will eventually change as the protocol matures.)

With that disclaimer in mind, if you're a self-starter and care deeply about Zorro's mission, your contributions could have a huge positive impact at this early stage! This document should help you get started.

Our website is found at [https://zorro.xyz/](https://zorro.xyz/), and you can join our community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Caj283PtN4). To learn more about our mission and goals, check out our [whitepaper](https://hackmd.io/@zorro-project/zorro-whitepaper).
